      The software you are about to use is free, open source, and unsupported beta software. It is important to understand that beta software refers to software that is undergoing testing and has not officially been released, could have bugs, and may not act in a reliable fashion. Because the software is currently in beta, it is possible but not certain that you may lose bitcoin or the value of your bitcoin. It is recommended that you store only nominal amounts of bitcoins. You acknowledge that your use of this software is at your own discretion and in compliance with all applicable laws. You are responsible for safekeeping your login IDs, passwords, private key pairs, PINs and any other codes you use to access the software. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF ANY WALLET ADDRESSES AND PRIVATE KEY PAIRS MAINTAINED IN YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY BITCOINS YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH WALLET ADDRESSES WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD AND/OR PIN.  All transaction requests are irreversible.  The authors of the software, employees and affiliates of Bitpay, copyright holders, and BitPay, Inc. cannot retrieve your private keys or passwords if you lose or forget them and cannot guarantee transaction confirmation as they do not have control over the Bitcoin network. You agree to provide accurate and complete information in connection with your use of the account. You assume any and all risk associated with the use of the software. To the fullest extent permitted by law, this software is provided “as is” and no representations or warranties can be made of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness or a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors of the software, employees and affiliates of Bitpay, copyright holders, or BitPay, Inc. be held liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
